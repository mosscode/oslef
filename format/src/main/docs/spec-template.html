<h3>OSLEF (Open Small-Loan Exchange Format)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this document is to define the OSLEF
specification.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>OSLEF data is represented by a directory containing CSV files.
The basic structure of these files must conform to the following CSV
specification:</p>

<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180</a>

<p>The first record in each file is a header record which assigns a
unique name to each column in the file. The following records must
contain data corresponding to these columns.</p>

<p>Additionally, to facilitate the flattening-out of one-to-many
relationships within loan data, an OSLEF-compliant CSV file has two
kinds of columns. The first kind may only be specified once. An example
of this is the loan_id column in the loans.csv file. The second kind may
be specified multiple times using a column name prefix followed by a
name that makes the column unique. A column prefix follows the format
PREFIX:NAME. For example, a loan might have more than phone number by
which to contact an applicant. In this case it would be possible to have
two phone number columns: 'phone:home' and 'phone:work'.</p>

<h3>Files Overview</h3>
<p>There are three distinct CSV files in the OSLEF format.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>loans.csv - this is the primary CSV file, as it contains most of
	the information related to a given loan. installments.csv - contains
	installment plan information. Each record references a record in the
	loans.csv file.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>history.csv - contains loan history information, including
	payments and other loan servicing activities which affect the balances
	of a loan's accounts (principal, fees, etc). Each record references a
	record in the loans.csv file.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>installments.csv - contains information on loan installment
	plans. Each record references a record in the loans.csv file.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
